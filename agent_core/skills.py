"""Skills - an agent's capabilities as named, reusable units.

A *skill* is a self-contained capability: a name, a human-readable purpose, the
model tier it runs on, the tools it may call, and the instruction that defines
it. ADK agents are assembled directly from skills, so the mapping
"capability -> agent" is legible in one place and the same skill can be reused
by an ad-hoc path or served over MCP.

Keeping guardrail expectations *in the instruction* means the model is told its
own limits; keeping tools *in the skill* means capability and authority are
declared together.

Verified against the google-adk API:
  * `from google.adk.agents import Agent`  (Agent is an alias for LlmAgent).
  * Constructor args used: name, model, description, instruction, tools,
    sub_agents, output_key.
  * Tools are plain Python functions (ADK builds the declaration from the
    signature + docstring) - passed directly in `tools=[...]`.
  * A parent delegates to a child by listing it in `sub_agents=[...]`; the
    child's `description` is what the parent's LLM uses to decide to transfer.
  * `output_key` writes each agent's final text into shared session state so
    later stages can read the running analysis.
