"""agent-core - the shared control plane for agent products built on Google ADK.

Extracted from the Atlas build in this monorepo (projects/devpost-30845). The
pieces every agent product re-implements, done once and tested:

  * skills      - capabilities as named units; assemble a supervisor from them.
  * guardrails  - read-only-SQL screen, content-safety screen, action rate limiter.
  * config      - env-driven settings base (subclass per app).
  * sinks       - guarded outbound actions (Slack alert, GitHub/endpoint ticket).
  * router      - domain-aware "send the outcome to the right place" router.
  * state       - durable run memory (Firestore + in-memory) with recurrence.
  * runner      - run an ADK agent graph and collect per-stage output.
  * mcp         - serve/consume tools over the Model Context Protocol.
  * demo        - `python -m agent_core.demo`, one end-to-end run of the above.

Typical wiring:

    from agent_core import (BaseSettings, Skill, build_supervisor, ActionLimiter,
                            ActionPolicy, Notifier, Router, AlertHandler, TicketHandler,
                            StateStore, run_agent)

    settings = BaseSettings(env_prefix="MYAPP")
    limiter  = ActionLimiter(ActionPolicy.from_env("MYAPP"))
    store    = StateStore.create(settings)
    notifier = Notifier(settings, limiter)
    router   = Router([AlertHandler(notifier), TicketHandler(notifier)])
